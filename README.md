## Hi there 👋
I’m currently studying Web Development at Cornerstone International Community College of Canada.
My goal is to become a Full-Stack Developer in Canada.
<!--
**keisei-dev/keisei-dev** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on learning how to use Git and GitHub to manage projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of the Command Line
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly projects where I can practice Git and project structure.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding branching, pull requests, and collaborating using GitHub.
- 💬 Ask me about my learning journey into web development as an international student in Canada.
- 📫 How to reach me: [imjoshuaa0019@icloud.com]
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: ⚡ I moved to Canada to start my tech journey — a year ago I didn’t know Git, and now I type in the command line more than I dribble a basketball.
